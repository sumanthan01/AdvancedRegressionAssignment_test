## General Information
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

## Problem Statement
You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions
- LotFrontage : If the Linear feet of street connected to property area increases then the Price increase
- BsmtFullBath : : If the BsmtFullBath area is more the SalePrice is higher
- Overall Condition: If the Overall Condition is Excellent the SalePrice is higher
- MSZoning_RH : If the house is near residential area then the SalePrice is higher
- Overall quality: If the Overall quality is Excellent the SalePrice is higher
- Exterior1st_CBlock : If the house Exterior is CBlock then price is less
- Garage Area: If the Garage Area is more the SalePrice is higher
- CentralAir: If the CentralAir is Yes the SalePrice is higher
